Inspired by this [gravity simulator](http://justfound.co/gravity/) authored by u/briandoesCode

This sandbox bases animations and interactions on formulas derived from Newton's law of universal gravitation.

My twist was to accurately generate planets along with all of their properties using elements from the periodic table.

Every click generates a planet with a randomly generated composition of elements that produce realistic values for mass, volume, and radius.
